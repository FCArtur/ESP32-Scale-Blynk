# ESP32-Scale-Blynk

## About

This example Arduino based code implements procedure of reading weighing data from ESP32 based IoT scale and send it to Blynk app.
HX711 Weighing module is used in that project.Used Blynk Virtual Pins is V16.
It needs to be installed Blynk library in Arduino program.

SDA pin is connected to GPIO26 and SCL pin - to GPIO27.
